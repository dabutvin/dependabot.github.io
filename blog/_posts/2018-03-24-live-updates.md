Dependabot can now create pull requests for you the minute new dependency
versions are released. ‚ö°Ô∏è

We've just released a new dependency update schedule option: "live". If you
select it (from the drop-down menu to the right of the "Bump now" button) you'll
receive dependency update pull requests in real time.

For now the "live" update schedule is only available for Ruby dependencies, but
we'll be rolling it out for all other languages in the next few days.
