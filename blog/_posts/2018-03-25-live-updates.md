Dependabot can now create pull requests for you the minute new dependency
versions are released. ‚ö°Ô∏è

We've just released a new dependency update schedule option: "live". If you
select it (from the drop-down menu to the right of the "Bump now" button) you'll
receive dependency update pull requests in real time.

We're keeping Dependabot's default update schedule as "daily" because for most
use cases we don't think you want dependency updates in the middle of the day.
Live updates are there if you want them, though.

**Note:** For now the "live" update schedule is only available for Ruby, PHP and
Elixir dependencies, but we'll be rolling it out for all other languages in the
next few days.
