Dependabot now checks custom Maven repositories specified in your `pom.xml` for
updates, as well as The Central Repository.

If you specify any customer repositories in your `pom.xml` you'll start to see
updates from Dependabot for dependencies from those repositories.

If you use a `settings.xml` file to specify your repositories and would like
Dependabot to be able to update those dependencies, too, please
[get in touch][get-in-touch].
