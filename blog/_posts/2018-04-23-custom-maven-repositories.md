Dependabot now checks custom Maven repositories specified in your `pom.xml` for
updates. If you specify any custom repos in your `pom.xml` you'll start seeing
updates from Dependabot for dependencies from them automatically.

If you use a `settings.xml` file to specify your repositories and would like
Dependabot to be able to update those dependencies, too, please
[get in touch][get-in-touch].
