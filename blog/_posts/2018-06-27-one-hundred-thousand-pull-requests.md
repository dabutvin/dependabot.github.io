Early this morning Dependabot's 100,000th dependency update pull request was
merged. It was to a private repo and upgraded the Ruby gem `selenium-webdriver`
from 3.12.0 to 3.13.0.

💯🎉💯🎉💯🎉💯🎉💯🎉

It's been quite a ride getting here! Here are some other Dependabot numbers:
- 5,406 repos are configured to receive PRs from Dependabot
- 5,146 Dependabot PRs merged last week
- 1,556 accounts use Dependabot
- 85% of accounts receive Dependabot completely free (it's free for open source
  and personal accounts, and always will be)
- 8 languages are supported (Ruby, Python, JS, PHP, Java, .NET, Elixir and Rust)
- 8,926 commits across the four services that run Dependabot

This is just the beginning - we've got big plans for the next year. For example,
as well as continuting to improve the core of Dependabot we're planning to add
an alert system for library maintainers that notifies them of bugs in new
releases, powered by Dependabot's data. Our recent creation of a
[semver stability badge][semver-badge] is just the first step there.

Thanks for using Dependabot and for helping make it what it is today.
